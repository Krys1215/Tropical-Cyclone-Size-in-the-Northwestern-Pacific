**Description**   
The satellite inversion of tropical cyclone scale information contains all satellite-captured tropical cyclones in the north-west Pacific Ocean, with a spatial coverage north of the equator and west of 180°, including the South China Sea. It contains 6-hourly position, intensity and scale information of tropical cyclones since 1980.   
   
In version 2.0, the time period of the data is extended to 2016, and samples below tropical storm (maximum wind speed of 17.2 m/s near the centre of the surface) are excluded, while others remain unchanged.
